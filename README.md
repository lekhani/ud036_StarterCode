# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

Run the code from Entertainment_center.py. It will create an html page with 
6 movie names and images which we have chosen. The respective movie trailer 
from youtube can be viewed if user clicks on the movie image.   
The code has been customized in media.py to open Google Chrome web browser 
instead of any default browser. There is also provision in media.py to use 
system default browser instead of chrome browser in media.py file but the 
code has been commented out. 

The code also uses UDACITY provided module fresh_tomatoes.py to publish the 
movie names, images and trailers.
